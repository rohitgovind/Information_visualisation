# Information_visualisation-Unveiling Sales Trends: A Visual Exploration of Customer Behavior and ProductÂ Performance

We have gathered two key datasets to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer preferences and transaction outcomes:

Dataset 1: Product Feedback Details
    This dataset contains detailed information on product transactions, including feedback from customers. It includes variables such as Transaction_ID, Customer_ID, Product_Category, Product_Brand, Product_Type, Feedback, Shipping_Method, Payment_Method, Order_Status, Ratings, and products. This dataset helps us understand customer feedback and satisfaction related to specific products and transactions.

Dataset 2: Customer Transaction Details
    This dataset captures a broader view of customer transactions, including demographic and purchase information. Key variables include Transaction_ID, Customer_ID, Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, Zipcode, Country, Age, Gender, Income, Customer_Segment, Date, Year, Month, Time, Total_Purchases, Amount, Total_Amount, Shipping_Method, Payment_Method, Order_Status, and Ratings. This dataset provides insights into customer demographics and their overall purchasing behavior.

Combining the Datasets:
    By merging these two datasets on the common identifiers, Transaction_ID and Customer_ID, we can create a more comprehensive view of the retail sales process. This merged dataset allows us to link customer demographics and transaction details with specific product feedback and ratings.

Planned Analysis:
- We will explore the preferences for shipping methods and payment options among different customer segments, analyzing how these preferences correlate with transaction outcomes such as order status and feedback ratings.
- By integrating insights from customer demographics and product feedback, we'll identify key drivers of customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
- Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, line charts, and scatter plots will be used to uncover relationships between customer segments, product categories, and transaction outcomes.

The objective is to provide actionable insights that help businesses understand which customer segments are most valuable, which products are most popular, and what factors contribute to positive or negative customer feedback. This analysis will offer valuable information for targeted marketing and product development strategies.
